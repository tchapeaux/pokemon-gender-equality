    <h1>Gender pay gap in the Pokémon video games</h1>
    <h2>Context</h2>
    <p>
      The
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon">Pokémon games</a>
      have been an international success for more than 20 years, with console
      games attracting hundreds of millions of players, a mobile app that
      became a global phenomenon, and a Hollywood movie.
    </p>

    <!--
      <p>
        Because they are such an important part of the video game and cultural
        landscape, it is intersting to wonder how they represent the world, and
        how our real-world biases might be translated in the fictional world.

    <p>
      In the video game narrative, the Player embodies a Pokémon trainer, who
      collects and trains many types of creatures. The main mechanic of the
      games is to fight other trainers, until the Player is crowned Pokémon
      Champion. After each victory, the Player is awarded a bit of
      <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Prize_money">prize money</a>
      from the defeated challenger. On the contrary, if the Player is defeated,
      they lose some prize money, the amount of which is exactly
      <em>half their current money</em>
      .

    <h2>Methodology</h2>

    <p>
      Our goal is to <strong>use the prize money system of the Pokemon games to
        estimate the gender pay gap between men and women in the Pokémon world.</strong>
    </p>

    <p>
      Interestingly, being a Pokémon trainer does not seem to be a
      full-time job, but rather a hobby enjoyed by almost anyone, be it
      scientists, police agents or politicians. Because the prize money amount
      is equal to half the current wealth of the defeated party, we suppose that
      the prize money amount is proportional to that person's salary, and
      analyze the pay gap directly from there.
    </p>

    <p>
      This analysis is based on the trainers encountered during the
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue">first generation of Pokémon games</a>, released
      in 1996. Note that subsequent re-releases of the games
      include more gender diversity in the trainers.
    </p>

    </p>

    <h3>Gender gap in the trainer encounters</h3>

    <p>
      This first graph is not concerned with the prize money yet. We just
      count how many men and women trainers the Player has the opportunity to
      fight during a normal playthrough of the game.
    </p>
    <canvas id="occurenceGraph"></canvas>
    <p>
      In the end, the player encounters 323 trainers, and only 77 of them are
      women.
    </p>

    <h3>Prize money gender gap through the game</h3>

    <p>
      In this graph, we count the total amount of money received by the player
      as prize money by men and women during the game.
    </p>
    <canvas id="throughTimeGraph"></canvas>
    <p>
      The graph is somewhat similar to the number of encounters, which seems
      consistent. However, the high difference between the number of men and
      women makes it difficult to compare the absolute value of prize money
      received by each gender.
    </p>

    <h3>Average prize money</h3>

    <p>
      To get a clearer picture, we look at the average value of the prize
      money after each encounter.
    </p>
    <canvas id="avgGraph"></canvas>
    <p>
      Even if the lack of diversity in trainers should be seen in itself as a
      problem, this analysis was concerned with the perceived wealth of each
      gender.
    </p>
    <p>
      From that point of view, the Pokémon world is surpringly
      gender-balanced. Both gender pay similar amounts of prize money during
      the game, with the women even paying 7% more (on average) than men at
      the end of the game. This means that men from the Pokémon world could
      argue that they
      <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2017/business/women-pay-gap/">work for free</a>
      26 days per year.
    </p>

    <p>
      More realistically, this difference is probably due to the very low
      number of female trainers, meaning that the women from the Gym Leaders
      and Elite Four subgroups (who acts as mini-bosses during the games with
      higher prize money) have a higher weight on the results.
    </p>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>

    <p>I don't really know, honestly. But this was fun to do.</p>
