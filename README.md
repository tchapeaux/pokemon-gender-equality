# Analysis of Gender Equality in Pokémon Gen1

You know sometimes when you wake up, you don't remember your dreams very well except for a single sentence or idea. For me, on the morning of Feb 25th 2021, it was this:

> Can we measure the gender pay gap in the Pokémon Gen1 games based on the payout at the end of each battle?

I'm not sure why or how my mind settled on this, but it seemed an interesting challenge.
This is the result of my journey to achieve this goal.

## See it

Go to http://www.thomaschapeaux.be/pokemon-gender-equality

## Build it

Build the data from the sources by running `npm run combine`.

Then launch a server (e.g. `npm run live-server`) to see the full analysis.
